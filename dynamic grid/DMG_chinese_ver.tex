%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan

In this talk, we present a two-dimensional triangular Delaunay mesh generation method based on local mesh adjustment on a bounded domain with moving boundary. By employing local mesh adjustment rather global re-generation, the developed method obtains good efficiency, while the Delaunay property of the generated mesh guarantees that the mesh has good quality. Furthermore, high dimensional embedding technology is combined with the proposed mesh generation method to generate the anisotropic mesh for a bounded domain with moving boundary. Some typical numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and robust of the proposed method.

Mesh generation is generally the first procedure in scientific computation, as well as the most costly step.According to the literature, the time needed for grid generation usually accounts for about 60\% of the total time of a computing task\cite{60}. Especially for unsteady problem, like geometric deformation or relative motion of multiple bodies, the mesh necessitate update at each time step of the solving procedure, which sharply increase the cost in generating mesh. Therefore, it is in demand to develop efficient and effective methods for dynamic mesh generation along with boundary change, with the mesh quality preserved.\\
\indent By moving the boundary of the bodies, it is able to describe the deformation or motion of that. So the dynamic mesh can be thought as a method for describing and moving the boundary. Generally speaking, there are two categories of method to achieve this goal: topology-preserved and topology-changed.\\
\indent Topology-preserved method, as the name shown, keeps the topology property after the change, which means that the points can only change its position but can not emerge or disappear. Meanwhile, to avoid the inverted grids, the motion of a single point must be never too big to cross an edge. Although having these disadvantages, topology-preserved method guarantees the conservation in flow field computation, which plays an important role in the continuity of the final solution. Specifically, spring stretch method and background graph mapping method are belong to this group.\\
\indent There are surely cases that the mesh can not preserve its topological property. For instant a body splitting into two parts, new edges and new points must be generated between the two parts. Hence the topology-changed methods are developed to deal with these essential topology-changed cases as well as the situation that mesh quality would become terrible if keeping the topology, like the relative motion.\\
\indent In this paper, we provide a simple but effective method to generate dynamic Delaunay based mesh. Because of the demand of Delaunay property, the topology property can not be preserved. The advantage of this method is the flexibility for large scale motion as well as the robustness provided by Delaunay generation algorithm. And to improve the efficiency, locally change is called instead of global regeneration. More, the high dimensional embedding method, which supports generating anisotropic mesh as well as adaptively refining the mesh, is combined with for better mesh quality.

\section{Delaunay triangulation and high dimensional embedding}
In this section, a brief introduction of Delaunay triangulation along with high dimensional embedding method is involved in order to develop the foundation for further discussion. Specifically, we mainly focus on the Lawson flip algorithm and the refinement algorithm, which are the fundamental algorithm in our dynamic mesh generation strategy.
\subsection{Delaunay triangulation}
To begin with, we put the definition of triangulation in 2-D here\cite{Discrete}:
\begin{myDef}
A triangulation of a planar point set $S$ is a subdivision of the plane determined by a maximal set of noncrossing edges whose vertex set is $S$.
\end{myDef}
\indent Generally, the triangulations of a certain point set are various. However, it is able to transform from one triangulation to another via a sequence of edge flips\cite{lawson}, which means removing the common edge of to adjoint triangles and adding the other diagonal.For instance the two figures shown in \ref{flip}, the transform from \ref{flip1} to \ref{flip2} is an edge flip.\\

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[htbp]{\label{flip}}
%\centering
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\subfigure{\label{flip1}}
\addtocounter{subfigure}{-2}
\subfigure[]{\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{distincttriangulation1.png}}}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.4\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\subfigure{\label{flip2}}
\addtocounter{subfigure}{-2}
\subfigure[]{\subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{distincttriangulation2.png}}}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\caption{sample of an edge flip}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

\indent Among all the triangulations of a certain point set, there are many circumstances in which certain triangulations are valued more highly than others. The Delaunay triangulation is an extremely important one. It has several equivalent definition from different points of sight. An accessible one is as follow:
\begin{myDef}\
For all triangles in a triangulation, if the circumcircle of that triangle has no points other than the three vertices inside, the triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation.
\end{myDef}
\indent This definition implies that the Delaunay triangulation provides the more regular triangles than other triangulations, which exactly the mesh necessitates for its quality.  Therefore, Delaunay based mesh generation methods are various, such as divide and conquer algorithm, incremental algorithm, get the dual graph of voronoi, and etc. In our strategy, the incremental algorithm based on lawson flip\cite{lawson}(the algorithm to transform a random triangulation into Delaunay via a selected sequence of edge flip) is used due to the flexibility as well as the robustness provided, even though the computational complexity is not the best.\\
\begin{algorithm}
\KwIn{\\A point set $S$\;}
\KwOut{\\A Delaunay triangulation $T$\;}
Randomly select 3 points to generate the first triangle.Remove the 3 points from $S$\;
\While{$S$ is not empty}{
Take one point,denoting $p$, and locate the point on current triangulation\;
\eIf{$p$ is in the convex hull of current triangulation}
{Call a 1-3 flip or 2-4 flip to insert the new point into the triangulation\;}
{Generate a new triangle with the proper edge on the convex hull and the new point\;}
Call the lawson flip to transform the new triangulation to Delaunay\;}
\caption{Delaunay triangulation generation algorithm}
\end{algorithm}
\indent Here the 1-3 flip and 2-4 flip refer to the point inserting strategy. If the point is in an triangle, then play a 1-3 flip transforming the triangle into 3 triangles. If the point locates on an edge of 2 triangles, then call a 2-4 flip transforming the 2 triangles into 4 triangles. Show in \ref{insert}.

\subsection{Constrained Delaunay triangulation and Delaunay refinement}
Delaunay triangulation provides an effective method generating quality mesh. Further more, the Delaunay triangulation of a certain point set is unique as long as the points are in general position,which means that no group of four points of are cocircular and no two points are in coincidence. However, in specific case, there may be some of the edges are necessary to form the boundary of the body while they are not in the Delaunay triangulation.Therefore, we have to constrain these edge to the final triangulation, which is called constrained Delaunay triangulation.\\
\indent Since the constrained Delaunay triangulation is global Delaunay with locally non-Delaunay, it is an effective way to generate a constrained Delaunay triangulation from the Delaunay triangulation via a series of flip to recover the constrained edge\cite{constrained1}.\\
\indent As for Delaunay refinement,it is a method to enhance the mesh quality via adding points outer from the original point set. Since the original point set may be non-uniform on the plane, even Delaunay triangulation may provide mesh with quite poor quality.For the time being, this method can be called to improve the quality via inserting extra points spliting big cell and causing flips to avoid small angle.Specificly, this procedure checks every triangles and insert points at the circlecenter of the too big ones,either, insert points at the constrained edges of the ones with too small angle\cite{refinement1}.By iterating the above procedure, the original Delaunay triangulation is refined and more uniformed.
\subsection{High dimensional embedding}
In \cite{hd embed}, Dassi, Si and Perotto provide a novel method for generating anisotropic mesh via high dimensional embedding.The main idea of this method is lift all the points into a high dimensional space,call embedding space, via an embedding function defined before. Then generate a quasi-Delaunay triangulation in this embedding space via a sequence of splitting , contracting and flipping of edges based on the embedding distance.Finally, project the quasi-Delaunay triangulation into the original plane.It is emphasized that the anisotropic property is inheriting from the embedding function.In other word, it is able to change the embedding function to view this method as an adaptive refinement algorithm.
\section{Dynamic mesh generation}
Our dynamic mesh generation strategy is based on the constrained Delaunay triangulation introduced in the last section.A series of consecutive constrained edge to represent the boundary of the body.The main quest is to move these edge to simulate the motion or deformation of the body.
\subsection{Overview of the algorithm}
Frankly speaking, the main idea of our grid-moving strategy is 'digging a hole' around the moving bodies to enable the motion of boundary without any intersection with other edges or points.After the movement of the boundary, lawson flip and delaunay refinement are called locally to refine the Delaunay property as well as the grid quality.\\
\begin{algorithm}
\KwIn{\\A point set $S$\\A series of vectors describing the motion of boundary points of each step $\{v_s^t\}$\\Max step $Maxstep$}
\KwOut{\\A series of meshes $\{M^t\}$}
Generate the triangulation of the first step\;
$step=0$\;
Output the triangulation as $M^{step}$\;
\While{$step<Maxstep$}{
Recover the segments from the refined triangulation by removing the free segment points\;
Remove the collision points and edges\;
Move the boundary edges via moving the constrained segment points $S_i^{step+1}=S_i^{step}+v_{S_i}^{step}$\;
Call locally lawson flip and locally Delaunay refinement\;
Output the triangulation as $M^{step}$\;
}
\caption{Dynamic mesh generation algorithm}
\label{DMGalgo}
\end{algorithm}
\indent This algorithm follows the commonsense of clear the barrier of moving objects. So that the objects can be moved directly without any collision. Since the algorithm employs removing and inserting of points, it is obvious an topology-changed dynamic mesh generation algorithm, which enables deformation,relative motion,and large displacement.Never the less, this generation strategy greatly decreases the time cost because no iteration is called in each step.
\subsection{Algorithm detail discussion}
In this subsection, the details of the above algorithm is discussed.\\
\indent Since the discription of boundary motion is restricted on the motion vectors at the constrained segment points, the free segment points must be removed to ensure the uniform of boundary edges and reduce the amount of triangles, which induces to the decrease of calculation.\\
\indent To remove the collision points, the collision points must be found out from the list of points first. According to the motion of each boundary edge, the points in the region it sweeping over are all collide to the edge. Therefore, it is able to remove the combine of collision points of all boundary edges. However, this strategy is computational inefficient since the search of collision points need to loop the full points list for each boundary edge.Thus, it is able to loose the criterion of collision points removing more points while decrease the search computation. In our case, a rectangle box,parelleling to coordinate, is employed covering the moving object and the place where it should move to. Moreover, to avoid too bad triangle after moving,the box is expand a little on each direction.Then it is able to loop only once within the points list to find out all the collision points according to this criterion. However,merely removing the collision points is not abundant beacuse collision edges may remain,shown in fig \ref{collision edge}.So to deal with the collision edges, it is available to flip all the collision edge from closer to further, to clear a way for moving the constrained segment points directly.\\
\indent After all the constrained segment points moved, the lawson flip and Delaunay refinement algorithm is called locally,to reduce the computational cost.Detailly, only the triangles adjacent to the constrained segment points are pushed into the flip queue as well as the refinement array.
\subsection{Dynamic high dimensional embedding}
To employ the high dimensional embedding algorithm into the dynamic mesh generation strategy, it is a trivial idea to modify the embedding function step by step, adjusting to the moving objects. Following this idea, the dynamic mesh generation strategy can be modified as locally lawson flip and Delaunay refinement replaced with high dimensional embedding function with dynamic embedding funciton.\\ 
\begin{algorithm}
\KwIn{\\A point set $S$\\A series of vectors describing the motion of boundary points of each step $\{v_s^t\}$\\Max step $Maxstep$\\Dynamic embedding funcition $F(x,y,t),\quad t=1,2,\cdots,Maxstep$}
\KwOut{\\A series of meshes $\{M^t\}$}
Generate the triangulation of the first step\;
$step=0$\;
Output the triangulation as $M^{step}$\;
\While{$step<Maxstep$}{
Recover the segments from the refined triangulation by removing the free segment points\;
Remove the collision points and edges\;
Move the boundary edges via moving the constrained segment points $S_i^{step+1}=S_i^{step}+v_{S_i}^{step}$\;
Dynamic high dimensional embedding\;
Output the triangulation as $M^{step}$\;
}
\caption{Dynamic mesh generation algorithm}
\label{DMGwithHDE}
\end{algorithm}
\indent This algorithem enable the generation of adaptive refined mesh along with dynamic generation, for instance, anisotropic grids around deformation boundary to simulate the boundary layer.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex,
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.




% conference papers do not normally have an appendix


% use section* for acknowledgment
\section*{Acknowledgment}


The authors would like to thank...
